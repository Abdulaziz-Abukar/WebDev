        <h3>Preperations</h3>
        <p>
          Before cooking noodles, it's essential to gather all the necessary
          ingredients and equipment. Start by selecting the type of noodles you
          want to cook, such as spaghetti, ramen, or egg noodles. Ensure you
          have a large pot for boiling water, a colander for draining, and tongs
          or a fork for stirring. You'll also need enough water to submerge the
          noodles completely, and optionally, salt to enhance the flavor. If
          you're planning to add vegetables, meat, or sauce to your noodles,
          prepare these ingredients by washing, cutting, and setting them aside.
          Finally, have a timer or a clock handy to monitor the cooking time,
          ensuring the noodles are cooked to the desired texture.

        <h3>Step by Step Guide</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Fill a large pot with water:</span> Add enough
            water to completely submerge the noodles, typically about 4-6 quarts
            for a pound of noodles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Add salt to the water (optional):</span> Add
            about 1-2 tablespoons of salt to the water to enhance the flavor of
            the noodles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Bring the water to a boil:</span> Place the pot
            on the stove and heat over high heat until the water reaches a
            rolling boil.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Add the noodles:</span> Once the water is
            boiling, add the noodles to the pot.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Stir the noodles:</span> Use tongs or a fork to
            stir the noodles, preventing them from sticking together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Cook according to package instructions:</span>
            Follow the cooking time recommended on the noodle package, usually
            between 8-12 minutes, depending on the type of noodle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Check for doneness:</span> Test a noodle by
            tasting it; it should be cooked but still firm, also known as 'al
            dente.'
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Drain the noodles:</span> Once the noodles are
            cooked to your liking, pour them into a colander to drain the water.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Rinse with cold water (optional):</span> If
            you're using the noodles for a cold dish or want to stop the cooking
            process, rinse them briefly with cold water.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Serve immediately:</span> Combine the noodles
            with your preferred sauce, vegetables, or meat, and serve hot.

        <h3>Preperations</h3>
        <p>
          To make delicious BBQ chicken wings, start by gathering all necessary
          ingredients and equipment. You'll need fresh or thawed chicken wings,
          your favorite BBQ sauce, olive oil, salt, pepper, and any additional
          seasonings you prefer, such as garlic powder or paprika. Ensure you
          have a large mixing bowl for seasoning the wings, a baking sheet lined
          with aluminum foil or parchment paper for easy cleanup, and a wire
          rack to place on the baking sheet for even cooking. Preheat your oven
          to 400°F (200°C) to get it ready for baking. If you plan to serve the
          wings with sides or dipping sauces, prepare those as well.
        </p>
        <h3>Step by Step Guide</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Preheat the oven:</span> Set your oven to 400°F
            (200°C) to ensure its ready for baking.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Prepare the baking sheet:</span> Line a baking
            sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper and place a wire rack on
            top.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Season the chicken wings:</span> In a large
            mixing bowl, toss the chicken wings with olive oil, salt, pepper,
            and any additional seasonings you prefer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Arrange the wings on the rack:</span> Place the
            seasoned wings on the wire rack in a single layer, ensuring they are
            not touching each other.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Bake the wings:</span> Put the baking sheet in
            the preheated oven and bake the wings for about 35-40 minutes,
            turning them halfway through the cooking time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Prepare the BBQ sauce:</span> While the wings are
            baking, warm your BBQ sauce in a small saucepan over low heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Coat the wings with sauce:</span> After the wings
            are cooked and crispy, remove them from the oven. Using tongs, toss
            the wings in the warm BBQ sauce until they are fully coated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Return to the oven:</span> Place the coated wings
            back on the wire rack and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes,
            allowing the sauce to caramelize and adhere to the wings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Check for doneness:</span> Ensure the wings are
            fully cooked by checking that the internal temperature reaches 165°F
            (74°C) and the sauce is slightly sticky and caramelized.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Serve immediately:</span> Transfer the BBQ
            chicken wings to a serving platter and serve hot, with your favorite
            sides or dipping sauces.

        <h2>Eggs</h2>
        <img class="image" src="imgs/eggs.jpg" alt="hot cooked eggs on a pan" />
        <h3>Preperations</h3>
        <p>
          To make perfect sunny side eggs, gather all necessary ingredients and
          equipment. You'll need fresh eggs, cooking oil or butter, salt, and
          pepper. Ensure you have a non-stick skillet or frying pan, a spatula,
          and a small bowl to crack the eggs into before cooking. If desired,
          you can also prepare additional seasonings or garnishes such as
          chopped herbs, cheese, or hot sauce. It's helpful to have a lid that
          fits your skillet to help cook the eggs evenly without flipping them.
        </p>
        <h3>Step by Step Guide</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Heat the skillet:</span> Place a non-stick
            skillet or frying pan on the stove over medium-low heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Add oil or butter:</span> Once the skillet is
            warm, add a small amount of cooking oil or butter, and let it melt
            and coat the pan evenly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Crack the eggs:</span> Crack each egg into a
            small bowl to ensure there are no shell pieces, then gently slide
            the eggs into the skillet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Cook the eggs:</span> Allow the eggs to cook
            undisturbed until the whites are fully set but the yolks remain
            runny, about 2-3 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Season the eggs:</span> Sprinkle salt and pepper
            over the eggs to taste. If you have a lid, cover the skillet for a
            minute to help the tops of the whites cook through without
            overcooking the yolks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Check for doneness:</span> The whites should be
            completely set, and the yolks should still be runny and bright.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Serve immediately:</span> Use a spatula to
            carefully transfer the sunny side eggs to a plate. Serve hot with
            your choice of sides, such as toast, bacon, or avocado.
